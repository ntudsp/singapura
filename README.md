The SINGA:PURA dataset is a strongly-labelled polyphonic urban sound dataset with spatiotemporal context. The data were collected via a number of recording units deployed across Singapore as a part of a wireless acoustic sensor network. These recordings were made as part of a project to identify and mitigate noise sources in Singapore, but also possess a wider applicability to sound event detection, classification, and localization. The taxonomy we used for the labels in this dataset has been designed to be compatible with other existing datasets for urban sound tagging while also able to capture sound events unique to the Singaporean context. Please refer to our conference paper published in APSIPA 2021 for more details regarding the data collection, annotation, and processing methodologies for the creation of the dataset.
